Project Overview
This project is a part of the Data Science Internship Level 1 tasks at Cognifyz Technologies. It includes three tasks focused on data exploration, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, and geospatial analysis. The goal is to understand the structure of the dataset, perform necessary preprocessing, and derive insights using statistical and geospatial techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various restaurants, including attributes such as location (latitude and longitude), cuisine, city, country code, and aggregate ratings.


Size: Multiple columns with restaurant-specific data
Target Variable: Aggregate rating
Tasks
Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Objective:

Understand the structure of the dataset.
Handle missing values and convert data types if necessary.
Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating").

Task 2: Descriptive Analysis
Objective:

Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."
Identify top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

Task 3: Geospatial Analysis
Objective:

Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude.
Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.
Results
The analysis provides insights into the dataset, including handling missing values, performing basic statistical analysis, and visualizing the geospatial distribution of restaurants. The interactive map and heatmap provide a clear understanding of the restaurant locations and their distribution.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of data exploration, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, and geospatial analysis on a real-world dataset. Each task is documented with Python code, making it easy to follow and replicate
